                I am presently a Part 4 student of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State Nigeria. A student of the Faculty 
                of Agricultute, department of Agricultural Economics. I've spent the past 3 years working across different

            <p class="about-content">
                These days my time are spent working to create a clean and user friendly website. Poised to also always learning 
                new ways to design, improve in my codespace and get better with more design. I have always had a thirst for personal
                development not only to get better at what I do but to also be able to add to any organization and to also produce the 
                best services. I also spend time teaching HTML, CSS and JavaScript to upcoming Front-End Developers. Outside work, 
                you will always find me dreaming of football, playing several musical instrument and enjoying myself by playing video games.
